\title{
Extended Nonparametric Actigraphy Measures for Multiple Actigraphy Files
}
\description{
Function returns IS, IV, RA, L5, M10 as well as L5 and M10 start times for single actigraphy files. Additionally, it also returns the L value (Lflex) and the start time for a specified number of minutes. The function also returns a classic dual day plot for the data, a plot of minutewise averages across 24 hours as well as a plot for hourly averages across 24 hours. 
}
\usage{
nparACT_flex_loop(path, SR, cutoff = 1, minutes, plot = T)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{path}{
Character string containing path to location of actigraphy files. Actigraphy files must contain a first column with a date/time vector, which must be of form \code{YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS} or \code{YYYY/MM/DD HH:MM:SS}, i.e. in an unambiguous date format and a second column with numeric actigraphy values. Input files can either be text or comma separated value files.
}
  \item{SR}{
Sampling rate in Hz.
}
  \item{cutoff}{
Can be used to define a cutoff for actigraphy data. Default value is \code{1}, i.e. all values are taken into account.
}
  \item{minutes}{
Number of minutes for which the Lflex value should be computed.
}
  \item{plot}{
If \code{TRUE} a plot is produced. Default is \code{TRUE}.
}
}

\value{
Data frame containing IS, IV and RA values for each file. Besides this, L5, M10 and Lflex (for the number of minutes specified) values are given along with the respective start times.
