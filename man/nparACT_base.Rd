\title{
Classic Nonparametric Actigraphy Measures for Single Actigraphy Files
}
\description{
Function returns IS, IV, RA, L5, M10 as well as L5 and M10 start times for single actigraphy files. The function also returns a classic dual day plot for the data, a plot of minutewise averages across 24 hours as well as a plot for hourly averages across 24 hours.

\usage{
nparACT_base(name, SR, cutoff = 1, plot = T)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{name}{
Character string containing the actigraphy file name. Actigraphy files must contain a first column with a date/time vector, which must be of form \code{YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS} or \code{YYYY/MM/DD HH:MM:SS}, i.e. in an unambiguous date format and a second column with actigraphy values.
}
  \item{SR}{
Sampling rate in Hz.
}
  \item{cutoff}{
Can be used to define a cutoff for actigraphy data. Default value is \code{1}, i.e. all values are taken into account.
}
  \item{plot}{
If \code{TRUE} plots are produced. Default is \code{TRUE}.
